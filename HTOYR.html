                <p>Got products but no idea when, how or where to use them? Lets get your routine in order.</p>
                <p>If you're not into fuss and like things simple, a standard 2-3 step routine would look like: Cleanse - Moisturiser - SPF(am)</p>
                <p>A good routine takes a bit more time and a few more steps than that.</p>

                        <p>Oil cleanser: An oil cleanser comes in 2 forms. Either a literal oil or in the form of a balm. Oil cleansers are used in the PM on a dry face to break down SPF and make-up, as well as other dirt and oils on your face as oil breaks down oil. You should oil cleanse for 60 seconds max. It's common to feel little gritty bits on your hands/finger tips as you rub, this is oil plugs coming out of your face. It is recommended to oil cleanse for 10mins max once every few weeks, but on a daily basis do not oil cleanse for more than 60 seconds. Once you have finised oil cleansing, take a hot cloth, place it over your face for a few seconds then proceed to wipe off all the oil and grime on your face. Another way to remove the oil is to emulsify it, splash water on your face and rub. Your oil/balm will turn milky white as you continue to wash it off with your hands and water. Once its all gone, time to go in with your actual cleanser like normal.</p>
                        <p>Cleanser: You know what a cleanser is, right? Great. Wash your face for 60 seconds. I promise it will make all the difference. Also, don't ngelect your neck, your ears, the corners of your nose and around/near your hairline.</p>
                        <p>Toner: Toners add hydration back to your skin after cleansing, they also remove any traces of residue you may have missed. Toners can either be hydrating or exfoliating. If you have an exfoliating toner, only use it 2-3x a week</p>
                        <p>Hydrate: Whew. There is a lot to say about hydrating your skin, so i'll try keep it short. Your skin is the largest organ on your body, drinking 8 glasses of water a day is cute and all, but your skin is the last place its going to. Hydrate your skin through ingredients such as Hylaronic acid </p>
                        <p>Eye cream: Eye creams are optional, within the skincare community there is divded opinion on whether they actually work. If you do choose to get an eye cream you need to look for these star ingredients to see any results: caffine, retinol, ginseng, green tea. If your under eyes are a massive concern to you, the only thing that will work dramatically is filler.</p>
                        <p>Exfoliants: Get rid of dead skin, will solve all your problems in life, the best skincare step ever. Everybody needs to be exfoliating chemically - do not use harsh scrubs, they damage your skin</p>
                        <p>Serums: Serums will help address whatever specific concern you want to focus on. Apply serums on damp skin and pat, dont rub!</p>                    
                        <p>Moisturiser: Everyone needs to moisturise. Everyone. If you're oily get a gel moisturiser, if you're dry get a cream moisturiser. Having a seperate moisturise for AM and PM is optional. I do :)</p>
                        <p>SPF: SPF is SO important and terribly neglected. Everyone on this planet needs SPF. I could write about this for hours. Instead, I'll let a professional tell you. Take notes</p>
